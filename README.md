# simCLR-med-img

This project focused on implementing a contrastive learning framework using PyTorch to process fMRI data. It uses a simplified version of SimCLR (Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations) to learn meaningful representations from fMRI images in an unsupervised way. These learned representations can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks like neurodegenerative disease classification.
