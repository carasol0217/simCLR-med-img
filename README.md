A simple neural network-based recommendation system built using PyTorch, this project aims to provide personalized clothing recommendations based on user-item interactions using collaborative filtering. This system uses a subset of the Polyvore dataset, a collection of fashion items, to suggest the best outfits or clothing items to users based on their preferences.
